## Installation

Install Choco.js using your favorite package manager:

```bash

bun add choco.js
```

## Usage

You can find more [examples](examples) under the examples directory.

```js
import Choco from "choco.js";

const app = new Choco.App({ port: 8080 });

app.get("/", (_ctx) => {
  return { hello: "world" };
});

app.listen((url) => {
  console.log(`Server is running at ${url}`);
});
```

## Middleware

Choco.js supports middleware for extending functionality. Here are some built-in middleware options:

### Logger Middleware

Logs details about incoming requests.

```js
app.withLogger({
    methods: ["GET", "POST"],
});
```

### CORS Middleware

Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support.

```js
app.withCors({
    origin: "*",
    methods: ["GET", "POST"],
    allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type"],
    exposedHeaders: ["Content-Type"],
    credentials: true,
    maxAge: 600,
});
```

### Cache Middleware

Caches responses for a specified duration.

```js
app.withCache({
    expires: 1000 * 10,
    maxItems: 100,
    maxLength: 1000,
    methods: ["GET"],
});
```
